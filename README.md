Driving game that I'm making as part of my first attempt at learning JavaFx

To-do list
==========

- Create a GUI for the entry point of the game.
- Progress bar for how far you've progressed along the track
- Finish line
- Timer and ability to record a time when completing a given race.
- More sprites for going on the track?
- Ability to choose longer or shorter race tracks with differing amounts of sprites on top

(Much Later)
- server & client
	- lobby with chat room
	- ability to play against other people with connections to the same server.
